## 👋 Introduction

**sd-webui-breadcrumbs** is a simple extension for the [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) that adds a breadcrumb trail to the Quicksettings menu.

It also improves the usability of Quicksettings by **1)** fixing it to the top of the screen and **2)** compressing it to a single row with a horizontal scrollbar.

If you find "menu diving" between extensions to be a tedious experience, **sd-webui-breadcrumbs** is for you.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Visit the **Extensions** tab of Automatic's WebUI.
2. Visit the **Install from URL** subtab.
3. Paste this repo's URL into the first field: `https://github.com/ThereforeGames/sd-webui-breadcrumbs`
4. Click **Install**.

## 📦 Features

- [x] ⬆️ Top and ⬇️ Bottom buttons for quickly jumping to the top or bottom of the UI
- [x] Buttons for scrolling to individual extension panels - it also opens the extension's accordion menu for you
- [x] Tab-aware: the breadcrumb trail will update itself when you switch between txt2img and img2img
