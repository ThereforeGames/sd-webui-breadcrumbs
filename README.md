## üëã Introduction

**sd-webui-breadcrumbs** is a simple extension for the [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) that adds a breadcrumb trail to the Quicksettings menu.

It also improves the usability of Quicksettings by **1)** fixing it to the top of the screen and **2)** compressing it to a single row with a horizontal scrollbar.

If you find "menu diving" between extensions to be a tedious experience, **sd-webui-breadcrumbs** is for you.

## üì¶ Features

- [x] ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Top and ‚¨áÔ∏è Bottom buttons for quickly jumping to the top or bottom of the UI
- [x] Buttons for scrolling to individual extension panels - it also opens the extension's accordion menu for you
- [x] Tab-aware: the breadcrumb trail will update itself when you switch between txt2img and img2img
- [x] Customize the appearance and behavior of the breadcrumbs through the WebUI settings page
